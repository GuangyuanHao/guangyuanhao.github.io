# About Me

<img src="https://guangyuanhao.github.io/guangyuan1.jpg" class="floatpic" width="1200" height="800">

I am Guangyuan Hao, currently serving as a research assistant with a focus on causality. My research is conducted under the guidance of esteemed professors [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and [Jiji Zhang](https://arts.cuhk.edu.hk/web/index.php/professor-zhang-jiji) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).

Additionally, since 2020, I have had the privilege of closely collaborating with Professor [Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/) at Rutgers University, specifically in the field of Safe /Trustworthy AI.

<!-- Furthermore, I am engaged in collaborative research endeavors with Professors [Yuanzhi Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aHtfItQAAAAJ&hl=en) and Kun Zhang at CMU, exploring the fascinating realm of the physics of Large Language Models (LLMs) recently. -->

## Research Interests

- Safe /Trustworthy AI
- Causality
<!-- - Physics of LLMs -->


My primary focus revolves around the development of theoretical frameworks aimed at explaining data and AI models and address real-world challenges to make AI systems trustworthy.

<!-- I am deeply dedicated to the field of causality, which plays a pivotal role in uncovering and comprehending cause-and-effect relationships. Causality inherently provides interpretability and robustness while enabling evidence-based decision-making. My ultimate goal is to extend the applicability of causality to deal with complex real-world data, such as images, texts, and videos.

Furthermore, I am fully immersed in the exploration of the Physics of Large Language Models (LLMs). My goal is to unravel the emergence of intelligence within these LLMs and potentially formulate corresponding theories. This endeavor aims to elevate the intelligence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and mitigate the risk of its misuse.

I firmly believe that substantial theoretical advancements are driven by real-world applications. My specific focus revolves around harnessing the combined power of causality and LLMs for applications in trustworthy AI and groundbreaking scientific domains, including automated theorem proving, protein research, materials discovery, and more. These domains are pivotal in identifying urgent challenges and unlocking the untapped potential inherent in causality and the physics of LLMs. -->
